# BlackLivesMatter Twitter Robot

# Installation
## Setting up the account
So you'll need a twitter account first of all. Next, you'll need to make an application via [Here](https://apps.twitter.com) and you might be required to apply for a developer account. As the credentials used in the twitter API are the creds generated by the twitter apps you make.

## Setting up the config
Add your Twitter API Creds to the `creds` object in the `config.json` in order from the website. I'd highly recommend keeping the same delay in the config to prevent constant rate-limiting. The maximum requests on Twitter are 15 requests every 15 minutes. Additionally, I'd just recommend keeping the threshold and cacheTTL the same to minimise hassle.

## Initializing the Robot
```
git clone https://github.com/devHazz/blm-twitter-robot.git
cd blm-twitter-robot
node .
```
The commands above will startup the robot!
